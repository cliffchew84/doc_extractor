This is my first attempt at loading a GitHub file
I took some code that I found online, which is saved as extract.py,
and modify it to load multiple Word documents files into a single
Excel Spreadsheet.

***
Just load the execute.py file and execute_extraction.py into the
folder that has all the necessary DOCX and TXT documents that need to be
converted into a single Excel Spreadsheet.

2 Excel files will be created. data has all the content from the
Word documents, with each Word document filling each Excel cell.
title list the names of all the DOCX and TXT documents that has been load
into the data.csv file.
