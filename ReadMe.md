This is my first attempt at loading a GitHub file
I took some code that I found online, which is saved as extract.py, 
and modify it to load multiple Word documents files into a single
Excel Spreadsheet. 

Just load the execute.py file and execute_extraction.py into the 
folder that has all the necessary DOCX documents that need to be
converted into a single Excel Spreadsheet.

2 Excel files will be created. data has all the content from the 
Word documents, with each Word document filling each Excel cell.
title list the names of all the DOCX documents that has been load
into the data.csv file. 

This is my first time uploading code onto Github, and I have tried
my best to credit the respective source of the code, by including
it into the module. If there is anything that I need to improve, 
please do contact me. I am not com science trained, and everything is
still a learning process for me. Comments for improvements are also
highly appreciated as well. Thanks. Cliff.
