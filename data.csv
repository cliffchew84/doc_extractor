"Trust no one, trust me on that. Restrains of present joy prepares one for future sorrow. Journeys are largely unrecognised when no destination is reached. There is one Earth, but six billion different worlds out there... You may not know your exact feeling, but you definitely know you are feeling something. Your lies can give you an advantage over everyone except yourself. If you cannot meet me when I am alive, you need not come to my funeral either. Worry not how someone can tarnish your reputations, because you can do that very well yourself. I take any blame my parents give me, because they gave me life. Technologies enhance our life, delay our deaths, but make death seem worse than it actually is. A moment of folly usually brings to a prolong regret. I am fine with getting nothing from you, but do not expect me to always contribute either. Assumptions and expectations are things humans should forget. We have no right to stop anyone from destroying themselves, but we can at least make them useful by stepping on them to our journey of success. If loving someone gives him/her so much pain, one should let go, even if it creates more pain for you than it reduces for him/her. If someone has the guts to request something from you, you should have the courage to reject him/her as well. Humans are the only living things that think too much. Language can only be as powerful as what the recipient can understand. People do not stop trusting others; they stop trusting themselves. People do not give up on love; they give up loving themselves. When you say for the sake of saying, you will only be heard for the sake of hearing. Why have great visions when the rest are blind? Human interpretations largely determine the good or bad. Are you genuinely sad or is just abusing your friends consolation and attention? Correct yourself before you correct others.  Knowing the truth is not as important as knowing to let go.  The things you attach to yourself usually create as much pain as they create pleasure.  Be careful with your words, as they can bring life to death, and also death to life. Failure by example is a failure in general. Help yourself before helping others. Only you can fully appreciate your own help. One should only be angry with himself for letting external influences bring him to a state of negativity.  Problems usually resolve themselves if you spend enough time listening to it. Money is used to determine an objects worth, not a person's worth. To deal with a problem, you either, solve it, run away or stop treating it as a problem. A great lie does not need to cheat everyone. You just need to be able to live with it. I do not know how big the universe is, but just how small I am.  If you approach things with a full heart, your mind and conscience will be clear. A step forward always leaves a trailing foot. The same applies to progress in life. For a species living in a three-dimensional world, many have too myopic and linear view of things.  Which is harder? To convince someone you are lovable, or to change yourself to suit the one you love. Humans tend to gratify themselves to fit the minimized world they created for themselves. Its easier to learn to enhance our strengths than to eliminate our weaknesses. Why try to understand others, when we usually cannot even fully understand ourselves?  Adults usually demand their children to do things they themselves cannot do.  Humane concepts of kind and fair are not meant for this savage world. It is easier to let go your hatred for others than to accept the hatred of others of you. Love is a social construct. How do we distinguish a helpful from a busybody? If you start somewhere, you will arrive somewhere. If you give to get, you will only get to give. Masses are only stepping stones for the elites. Humans want what they do not have, while throwing away what they have. It is Fate that you do not believe in Fate. Too much of anything is always bad. Moderation is key. The stupid act smart, while the smart play dumb.  From those they love, some learn to accept, while some learn to let go. Complaining without action is like screaming for help out in the ocean without trying to keep afloat. Why do we care if the cup is half full or half empty, when we should see if there is a leak? A brainless human is like a toothless lion. Life will ease up once you harden up. Stop interacting with who you are bitching, and everyone around you will appreciate the silence.  Your brain plans, but it is your heart executes. Love is like chewing gum. The start is sweet, but you either end up chewing it out of habit or spit it out when things turn sticky. Conflicts occur as a stubborn soul tries to instil his thinking onto another stubborn soul.  I should be born to live to no one elses standards but my own. I cannot make the whole world like me, but I can at least know my haters and avoid them. Your weakness and cowardice will come to your defence when you are trial for murder. Sometimes we try so hard to achieve an objective that we forget that letting go may be more relieving."
"Forward-Looking Behaviour in Singapore's Private Housing Market: The Impact of the North-East Transit Line on the Housing Price Gradient Summary This paper seeks to investigate the effects of the North-East Line (NEL) Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) extension on neighbouring private housing resale prices. A hedonic price analysis on the Singapore private housing market is conducted using 99-year non-landed resale private houses and Executive Condominiums (EC) transactions located near the NEL from 1st January 1995 to 31st December 2008. The Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and the spatial expansion method were used to estimate the hedonic price model. After controlling other variables, the estimations show the presence of positive announcement effects and negative construction effects on the non-landed private resale prices located within 800 metres of the NEL development. In particular, the announcement effects from the NEL were so strong that housing prices were higher than the prices levels when the NEL became operational. This suggests that the private resale housing market was over-reactive to market news on the NEL developments. Keywords: Hedonic price. Spatial econometrics. Transport infrastructure. Housing Introduction The construction of the North-East Line (NEL) transit system in 2003 was targeted to serve residents in the North-East, and designed to connect the existing East-West and North-South MRT transit lines. The projects construction spanned from November 1997 to June 2003, cutting through high population density areas such as Chinatown, Serangoon and Clarke Quay. Land and developed areas made way for its construction, while nearby residential houses and commercial buildings had to endure the heavy construction and tunnelling works from the project during its construction phase. This paper attempts to identify the effects of the NEL on neighbouring private resale housing prices. A hedonic price analysis is chosen to analyse the transaction prices of the private resale houses located near the NEL project from 1995 to 2008. This allows the investigation of how the announcement, construction and operational phases of the NEL project affected neighbouring housing prices. In addition to the OLS model, Cans (1992) spatial expansion model is used to estimate the hedonic price model to account for spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation. Chapter 1 reviews the literature. Chapter 2 provides a brief overview of the NEL project. Chapter 3 explains estimations and empirical results. Chapter 4 concludes the main findings and possible extensions. 1. Literature Review 1.1 Urban Spatial Structures Early monocentric urban models suggest that rising land costs in a citys main central business district (CBD) area will allocate land use according to some left over principle. Monocentric urban models confound that accessibility to central urban areas made these areas highly sought after, and this was reflected through the higher land and rent prices that lead to the negative bid-rent functions (Alonso, 1964; Muth, 1969; Von Thunen, 1826). However, as technological improvements reduced transportation time and costs, cities began to sprawl and they increasingly had spatial layouts that were not predicted by the monocentric spatial models. Since then, polycentric models have considered for dual-workplace households (Madden, 1980), segregation of suburban and urban workers employment locations (Yinger, 1992) and differentiating employment areas with consumption nodes (Brueckner, 1979; Landsberger and Lidgi, 1978). Developments in the hedonic price model led to its adoption in housing market studies. Following Lancasters (1966) work on attribute-based evaluation of consumer goods, the hedonic price model treats the housing quality and price as a composite of its locational and structural attributes. Interestingly, hedonic price models have shown both monocentric (Bailey, Muth and Nourse, 1963; Chung and Chan, 2003; McMillen, 2003) and polycentric housing price gradients (Bender and Hwang, 1985; Heikkila, Gordon, Kim, Peiser and Richardson, 1989; Waddell, Berry and Hoch, 1993) across different housing markets.  1.2. Hedonic Price Models and Transportation Developments Hedonic price models are commonly used to isolate the marginal price of transportation infrastructure developments on housing prices. This is because access to transportation services increases the neighbouring household accessibility, and hence, is expected to increase their housing prices. In addition, studies have shown that some transportation infrastructure developments led to positive announcement and anticipatory effects on neighbouring housing prices (Bae, Jun and Park, 2003; Damm, Lerman, Lerner-Lam and Young, 1980; McDonald and Osuji, 1995; McMillen and McDonald, 2004; Wang 2010). For the Southwest Rapid Transit Line in Chicago, which opened in 1993, McDonald and Osuji (1995) and McMillen and McDonald (2004) found positive and statistically significant anticipatory effect on residential land prices in 1990 and 1987 respectively. However, some studies also found non-positive effects. Gatzlaff and Smith (1993) found that the announcement and operations of the Miami Metrorail system had no positive effects on neighbouring housing prices, while the Metrolink in Greater Manchester had a negative impact on neighbouring housing prices (Forrest, Glen and Ward, 1996). The announcement of the Supertram construction in Sheffield also caused neighbouring housing prices to decline, although subsequent increases in housing prices after trams completion was suggested as evidence of the gained accessibility by neighbouring households (Heneberry, 1998). In Singapore, hedonic price models have been used to construct a constant-quality price index for Housing Development Board (HDB) resale flats (Ong, Ho and Lim, 2003), and to estimate how political boundaries (Wei and Wong, 2010), ethnicity (Wong, 2008) and proximity of primary schools (Wong, 2008) effect housing prices. In particular, hedonic price models were used to study the effects of transit developments on housing prices in Singapore. Using the stations Chinese Garden, Chua Chu Kang, Serangoon and Bishan, Lee (2009/2010) found that average housing prices near an underground train station was greater than those located near an above ground station by around 2% to 3%. Lee attributed this difference to the operational noise from the above ground stations. Tan (2009/2010) found that announcement of the Pioneer train stations construction rose neighbouring HDB resale housing prices by 22.6% above pre-announcement levels. Even during the stations construction phase, the housing prices were 6.61% higher than pre-announcement levels. However, when the station became operational, housing prices were only 7.14% higher than pre-announcement levels. Ong (2001) found that HDB resale flats nearer to the East-West transit line stations experience a price premium, with those further from the CBD enjoying an even greater premium for locating near an East-West transit line station. Studies have also found that proximity to NEL train stations had a positive effect on the prices on public and private housing prices (Chan 2004/2005; Quek 2004/2005). In particular, Quek (2004/2005) found positive announcement effects from the NEL project that were as high as 34.9% during the 3rd quarter of 1998. However, other studies on the Circle Line development found both positive and negative announcement effects for houses located near different train stations along the Circle Line (Chia, 2008/2009; Wu, 2007/2008).  1.3. Non-OLS Hedonic Price Models Beyond the OLS framework, other estimation methods have been developed to help in the hedonic analysis of housing markets. Meese and Wallace (1991) adapted the non-parametric locally weighted regression (LWR) by Cleveland and Devlin (1988) and Cleveland, Devlin and Grosse (1988) to the construct of the housing price indices for Alameda and San Francisco Counties. Knight, Dombrow and Sirmans (1995) constructed a seeming unrelated regression (SUR) hedonic price model that allows the marginal effects of housing attributes to change over time. Brunsdon et al.s (1996) geographically weighted regression (GWR) allows spatial variables to be estimated at each observation point, and weight observations by their distance to this point, eliminating the need for a prior function form in the estimation.  Spatial econometrics was developed to address the problems of spatial heterogeneity and spatial autocorrelation in analysing spatial data (Cliff and Ord, 1981; Upton and Fingleton, 1985; Anselin, 1988, 2001; Can, 1990, 1992). Spatial heterogeneity occurs when observations exhibit locational differences across a geographical space. Failure to consider for spatial heterogeneity is a specification problem that will affect the accuracy of the models estimation. The use of regional dummies can help account for certain location-specific differences, but the discrete nature of regional dummies cannot account for continuous spatial heterogeneity that is common to the spatial structure of housing markets. Spatial autocorrelation is where interactions occur between neighbouring observations across the geographical area. Such interactions violate the independence assumption of variables in the OLS model, and hence, require regression techniques that can incorporate the spatial dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or implicitly by means of an autoregressive and/or moving-average structure (Cliff and Ord, 1982; p.142). Housing realtors that estimate a housing units transaction value commonly factor in the prices of neighbouring houses that were sold recently, and this leads to the problem of spatial autocorrelation.  Due to the inherent geographical characteristics of housing markets, spatial econometrics has been used in some hedonic housing studies. Thriaut, Des, Villeneuve and Kestens (2003) adopted Cans (1990, 1992) spatial expansion method with the principal factor analysis to investigate the housing market of the Quebec Urban Community, and showed that the spatial expansion method can address some issues of spatial autocorrelation. Bitter, Mulligan and Dallerba (2007) showed that although the GWR provides greater explanatory powers and predictive accuracy than the spatial expansion method, the latters ability to handle a large number of variables and interactions (Bitter et al., 2007, p. 23) makes it a better model to investigate the underlying determinants of housing."
